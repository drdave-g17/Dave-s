I’ve created a modern app store website with a beautiful, contemporary design. Here’s what I’ve built for you:

Key Features:

Clean hero section with stunning background imagery
Featured apps showcase with ratings and download counts
Category browsing with visual icons
Popular apps grid layout
Newsletter subscription section
Mobile app download promotion
Responsive design for all devices
Design Highlights:

Modern blue and purple color scheme
Professional typography with the Pacifico font for branding
Interactive elements with hover effects
Card-based layout for better organization
High-quality placeholder images for apps and categories
Statistics section showing app store metrics
The website includes sections for featured apps, popular downloads, category browsing, and user engagement features. All app cards are marked for potential Shopify integration if you want to sell apps later.

Next Steps You Could Consider:

Add user authentication and accounts
Connect to a database to store real app data
Implement search and filtering functionality
Add app detail pages with screenshots and reviews
Set up payment processing for paid apps
The design is fully modern and ready to use with realistic app data and beautiful visuals throughout.

I understand you’d like me to respond in English. Your app store website looks great!

Improve functionality like search, filters, or user interactions
Add data storage capabilities with Supabase
Connect payment processing for paid apps

What would you like to work on next?

Buy this app website and to sell by Money

I understand you want to add payment functionality to your app store website so customers can purchase apps. To set up payments, I’ll need to connect your project to Supabase first (for secure backend functionality), and then add payment processing.

Let me help you add the ability to sell apps for money:

First, we need to connect to Supabase for secure backend operations
Then we’ll add payment processing capabilities
Finally, we’ll update your app cards with purchase buttons and pricing
Connect Supabase
Once Supabase is connected, I’ll help you set up:

Payment processing for app purchases
User accounts and purchase history
Secure checkout process
App delivery system after purchase
Would you like me to proceed with setting up the payment system once Supabase is connected?

Yes

I understand you want to set up payment functionality for your app store website so customers can purchase apps. To enable this, I need to connect your project to Supabase first, which will handle user authentication, database storage, and secure payment processing.

Connect Supabase
Once Supabase is connected, I’ll help you set up:

User authentication and accounts
Secure payment processing for app purchases
Purchase history and app delivery system
Database to store app information and transactions
This will transform your app store into a fully functional marketplace where customers can buy apps with real money.

Yes I want

I understand you want to set up the payment system for your app store! Since we need to handle real money transactions, let’s first connect to Supabase to set up the foundation for user accounts and secure payments.

Connect Supabase
Once Supabase is connected, I’ll help you create:

User authentication system for customer accounts
Secure payment processing for app purchases
Purchase history tracking
App delivery system after successful payment
This will transform your app store into a fully functional marketplace where customers can buy apps with real money!
